            <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
            <p>Learn and be entertained. Come and catch daily educational and entertaining shows, talks and demonstrations at the amphitheatre.</p>            <p>Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa. Although their range covers a small percentage of Africa, gorillas cover a wide range of elevations. The mountain gorilla inhabits the Albertine Rift montane cloud forests of the Virunga Volcanoes, ranging in altitude from 2,200 to 4,300 metres (7,200 to 14,100 ft). Lowland gorillas live in dense forests and lowland swamps and marshes as low as sea level, with western lowland gorillas living in Central West African countries and eastern lowland gorillas living in the Democratic Republic of the Congo near its border with Rwanda.Gorillas' natural habitats cover tropical or subtropical forests in Africa.
